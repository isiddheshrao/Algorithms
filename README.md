# Algorithms
Consists of Sorting and Other algorithms coded from scratch as a Self-Project

How to run the code: Use Command Line Interface: python3 sorting_algorithms.py

Design of User Interface: After running the code from command line, you will be asked the following: 
Please enter your choice of sorting algorithm (Enter 'Merge'/'Heap'/'Quick'/'Insertion'/'Bubble'):

Enter one of the following options (Input is not Case Sensitive). Invalid option will by default ask if you want to run a function which compares all algorithms and plots a graph of time vs list size. Do you want to see time vs list size graph for all algorithms? (Y/N):

If you enter ‘y’, the function compares all algorithms by generating random list of integers of size (1-1,000) with list size ranging from 1-100 (Can change list size on line 207 of code) and plot them on a graph with respect to time. 

Libraries used: No external libraries are used for developing the algorithms. sys is used for exit function, random is used for generating random numbers, time is used to calculate execution time and use it for graph plotting, matplotlib.pyplot is used for graph plotting.
